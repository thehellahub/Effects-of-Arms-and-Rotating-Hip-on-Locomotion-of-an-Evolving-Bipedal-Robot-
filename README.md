# Effects-of-Arms-and-Rotating-Hip-on-Locomotion-of-an-Evolving-Bipedal-Robot-

Code repo for programming evolutionary neural networks for the purpose of teaching a digital robot how to walk on it's own. In developing the "brains", we will also test fitness functions against each other to see how attributes such as arms and a rotating hip effect the gait of the robot.
